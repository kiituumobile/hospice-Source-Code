      <h3><a name="desc">Description</a></h3>
      <p>This is a web based chat application and uses only JSP and Servlets. It doesn't use applets,
      activeX controls or database. It isn't a commercial application but a
      freeware, which shows
      how JSP and Servlets can be used. If you
      know Java and JSP you can also <a href="http://www.web-tech-india.com/software/download.php?fileName=chatsrc.zip">download</a> source code
      of Java Classes and try to extend this application yourself.</p>
			<p><i>Note: If you are looking for socket based chat application in Java that can be downloaded from
            <a href="http://www.web-tech-india.com/software/download.php?fileName=applet.zip">here.</a></i>
      <p>This chat application can be used for group discussion. You
      can download and use it in anyway you like but, please, don't remove the author information from any
      file. Here is a screen shot of a chat session:</p>

      <p>Here are some of the things this chat application supports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It supports rooms. Users can create their own rooms.<p align="center">
        
        <a href="images/listroom.jpg" target="_blank"><img border="1" src="images/listroom_small.jpg" width="300" height="163"></a><p>
        
        
        
        </li>
        <li>It allows users to find other logged in users.

          <br>
        </li>
        <li>It informs users in particular room when someone joins, leaves the room or logs out.
          <p align="center"><a href="images/chat2.jpg" target="_blank"><img border="1" src="images/chat2_small.jpg" width="300" height="189"></a><br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>It allows users to store some personal information which can be viewed by others.

      <h3><a name="req">Requirements</a></h3>
      <p>This application needs container with support for Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 specification because it uses
      listeners which are available only in Servlet 2.3 specifications. Tomcat 4/5/5.5 and Resin 2.1 or
      greater, both support Servlet 2.3 spec.
      <p>It may work on Servlet 2.2 container but problem you'll face is, if a user doesn't log out
      manually then his object won't be removed from application ( ServletContext) object. When his session
      expires his session will be destroyed automatically but information stored in
      application object won't be destroyed and will remain there.

      <h3><a name="note">Note</a></h3>
      <p>It is not fully tested and bug free application as it has not been
      tested on a production server. But this application has been available for
      download since April, 2003 and no one has yet reported any problem with
      it.<p>If you find any bug then please send author an <a href="mailto:ssruprai@hotmail.com">email</a>. If
      he had time he'll try to fix it. But please don't ask how to configure it
      in your Servlet container as it works out of the box in Tomcat and Resin. Developers&nbsp;can also
      <a href="http://www.web-tech-india.com/software/download.php?fileName=chatsrc.zip">download</a> source code of Java classes (which can be easily extended) and try to fix bugs or extend and improve this application.
      After fixing bugs or extending this application you can send author the modified files so that
      he can update the
      application in future.<p>Author wrote this application because he wanted to know how web based chat applications work and to improve
      his knowledge of JSP and Servlets. He was not able to find some complete example of it on web.
      He read Professional Java Server Programming from wrox and it provided him
      a starting point. As author just wanted to show how chat applications
      work, there is minimal validation done on
      user input. Validation is done only when it may affect the application functionality as it is
      just a demonstration of author's work. For example, an email
      address user provides, is not validated. But validation can be easily added.
      <p>This application makes heavy use of ServletContext to store every object as no database is
      used. It is just plug and play kind of thing. So memory requirements may be high. Memory
      requirement will depend upon the number of users currently logged in.
      <h4 class="error">It won't, but if this applicationh crashes or harms your computer in any way,
      author won't
      be responsible for it.</h4>

      <p>Before downloading this application, you must read <a href="#note">note above</a>. Then Download this
      <a href="http://www.web-tech-india.com/software/download.php?fileName=chat.zip">zip</a> file (261 kb).
			After downloading this <a href="http://www.web-tech-india.com/software/download.php?fileName=chat.zip">zip</a>
      file extract its contents somewhere. In extracted files there will be a file named chat.war. Copy
      this chat.war to your Servlet/JSP container's webapps directory.
      For Tomcat 4.1 / 5.0 / 5.5 and Resin 2.1 there is a sub-directory named <i>webapps</i>. Copy this chat.war
      file to this webapps directory and start your container or server. Then you can
      access this application by using a URL like <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080/chat</a>/.
      Replace localhost with name of your server. If your container/server is using some other port, then change port number from 8080 to that port.
      <p>Developers&nbsp; can also <a href="http://www.web-tech-india.com/software/download.php?fileName=chatsrc.zip">download</a> source code of Java classes

      <h3><a name="conf">Configuration</a></h3>
      <p>You can configure this application by changing some parameters is <i> WEB-INF/web.xml</i> file in
      chat.war. To edit this file before deploying you have to extract contents of this chat.war file. In the files extracted there will be a directory named
      <i>WEB-INF</i>. In this
      directory there will be a file named <i>web.xml</i>. In this <i> web.xml</i> file you can change the options
      given in the table <a href="#options">below</a>. After making the changes you have to recreate the
      chat.war file
      again. You can create this war file using any zip utility like JDK's <i>jar</i> or WinZip. After creating
      the zip file just change its extension from zip to war. There is also a file named <i>chat.properties</i>
      in <i> WEB-INF</i> directory, which stores the name of chat rooms and their description. At server
      startup this file is read. If this file is missing then error is displayed in console and
      application won't work. There are few initialization parameters which can be changed. Comments
      have been added to this <i> web.xml</i> file about the settings you can change. There are six
      parameters you can change.
